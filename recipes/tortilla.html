        <p class="desc">This Spanish-style egg and potato omelet may not be 
            fancy, but it's certainly a hearty meal that everyone
            will enjoy. Crispy fried potatoes and onions are 
            cooked with eggs, then garnished with tomatoes and 
            green onions for color and flavor.

        <h3 class="subtitle">ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
            <li>½ pound potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 medium tomatoes - peeled, seeded, and coarsely chopped</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="subtitle">step-by-step</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Add potatoes and season lightly with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crisp, 10 to 14 minutes. Add onions; cook and stir until soft and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Pour eggs into the skillet and stir gently to combine with potatoes and onion. Reduce the heat to low and cook until eggs begin to brown on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Loosen omelet with a spatula. Invert a large plate over the pan, and carefully flip omelet out onto the plate. Slide omelet, uncooked-side down, back into the pan. Cook until eggs are set, 4 to 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Serve warm, garnished with tomato and green onion.</li>
        </ol>
